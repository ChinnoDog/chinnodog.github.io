I realize this is a very specific post, but I figured that I had done the research already and someone else out there might find this useful.  When you go to HP’s site to download the driver for the M1522 printer (and some others) you find a bewildering array of choices such as the ones on [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20110203085002/http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&cc=us&prodNameId=3442754&prodTypeId=18972&prodSeriesId=3442750&swLang=8&taskId=135&swEnvOID=4063).  Under the Software subheading you find the following:

  * HP LaserJet M1522 MFP Series Full Solution AM-EMEA1
  * HP LaserJet M1522 MFP Series Full Solution AP
  * HP LaserJet M1522 MFP Series Full Solution EMEA2
  * HP LaserJet M1522 Series Full Solution EMEA3
  * HP LaserJet M1522 Series Full Solution EMEA4

There is no further comments on what these are or what EMEA stands for.  After some Googling I finally found out that EMEA is a code for the supported languages.  It is contained in [this post](http://web.archive.org/web/20110203085002/http://forums11.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/bizsupport/questionanswer.do?admit=109447626+1271720721515+28353475&threadId=1352032).  I have pasted it below for reference.

Thanks HP for making this so difficult….
